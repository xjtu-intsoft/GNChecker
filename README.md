# GNChecker

GNChecker is a compliance checking tool with low false negatives and finer granularity.  This tool is divided into three main components: program behavior analysis, privacy policy analysis, and consistency analysis. In the program behavior analysis, we employ both static data flow analysis and dynamic network traffic analysis to identify which types of information will be sent to where, and these data transmission behaviors are mapped to IT-TA (Information Type, Transmission Address) tuples. For privacy policy analysis, we map the declared privacy policies to tuples of DCP-IT to represent which data collection party will collect what information. Finally, during the consistency analysis phase, we utilize pre-constructed dictionaries for DCPs and types of information to expand the aforementioned tuples into triples of DCP-IT-TA . And then through a process of consistency comparison, we identify inconsistencies.
